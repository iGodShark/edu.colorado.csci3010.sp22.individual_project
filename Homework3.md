# Homework 3

### What I planned on doing for this deadline:

I want to get a simple GUI going that renders a random maze, which will verify  that you can get from the top left corner to the bottom right corner via a breadth first search (will be a test-case).

I also want to render a simple circle for the player and allow for movement throughout the maze.

I want to be able to check if the player has reached the finish game, and get a finish screen with the option to play again.

At this point, I should have a working “blind” maze

### What I actually accomplished:

The main thing I got done is my maze generation algorithm and the rendering of the maze. A lot of what I was doing was watching tutorials on JavaFX, which I fell comfortable with now.
However, this means that there isn't much for me to show for this deadline. I definitely could've accomplished more for this deadline, and I wasn't working to my full potential.
For the next deadline, I will dedicate much more time towards this project.

### My plan for the next deadline:

Speaking of, for the next deadline, I had originally planned to do the following:

I want to get a mini map going that renders as you visit each room in the maze.

A pause menu that shows a blown-up version of this mini map.

I want to get enemy logic, which will generate a certain number of enemies in 
random locations, which will start a “fight” when the player goes near the 
enemies. The fight screen should show the player and enemy’s HP and allow the 
player to select one of two moves in each turn and the enemy chooses a random 
move.

Check if the player is out of HP and get a death screen with the option to play 
again.

Get random weapon generation going and create a backpack for the player. 
Outside of a fight, the player can select which weapon the player wants to use in a 
fight, and give the stats of that weapon (attack, speed and accuracy).

Get random special power-up going, and allow a player to select the power-up 
outside of a fight. This will give a description of what it does (the stats change).

I plan on adding on to this what I didn't finish for this deadline. This may seem a bit unrealistic, but I have more time for this milestone along with a Spring Break.
Following is a screenshot of a sample maze my algorithm generated:
