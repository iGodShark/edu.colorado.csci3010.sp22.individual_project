# Homework 5 FINAL

### What I planned on doing for this homework deadline:
- Finish all pixel art for items and enemies
- Render all graphics
- Create a backpack view
- Show item descriptions when hovering in backpack view
- Show weapon descriptions when hovering in backpack view
- Create fight view
- Get into fight when player crosses by an enemy
- Add weapon behavior when fighting

### What I actually accomplished for this deadline:
- Finally, I accomplished everything on my TODO list. There's so much I did it's hard to list. Basically, I finished the game and made it playeable. The graphics are terrible and it could be better. I could definitely spend a few hours touching it up and making it look neater, but at this point I was just trying to get the game to be playable and runnable.

### What I plan to do for the next deadline:
Well, there is no next deadline...
