## How to run:

Maven and the .idea/libraries folder should handle all dependencies. Simply open this project in IntelliJ, and run the Main class. Alternatively, you can run the .jar file inside of the out/artifacts folder.

## How to play:

Get to the bottom right corner of the maze to win. You will encounter enemies along the way, so try to make it out alive.

Move using the arrow keys or using WASD controls.

Press B to open up the backpack. In the backpack, hover over items and weapons to see what they do. Click on the weapon you wish to have as your active weapon.

Press ESC to open up the pause screen where you can see the mini map a bit better.

Good luck!
